IntellijEve is designed as a plugin for the IntelliJ IDEA development 
environment from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/).
Therefore a recent version of this software is required to run the 
plugin.
We recommend version 2018.1 as we used it during development and the 
plugin was tested with this version.
